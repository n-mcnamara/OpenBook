# OpenBook - A Decentralized Goodreads Alternative on Nostr

OpenBook is a censorship-resistant and decentralized social platform for book lovers, built on the Nostr protocol. It aims to provide the core functionality of Goodreads without the centralized control of a single corporation.

This project was built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and the Nostr Dev Kit (NDK).

## Features

The current MVP includes the following features:

- **User Authentication:** Log in securely using any NIP-07 browser extension.
- **Book Search:** Discover books by title or author using the Open Library API.
- **Bookshelves:** Organize your reading life by shelving books as "Want to Read," "Currently Reading," or "Read."
- **Reviews & Ratings:** Add a 1-5 star rating and a written review for any book you've read.
- **User Profiles:** View any user's bookshelves and Nostr profile (name, bio, avatar).
- **Home Feed:** See the recent book-related activity from the people you follow.
- **Follow/Unfollow:** Manage your social graph directly within the app.
- **Edit Content:** Update or change your shelf status, rating, or review for any book.
- **Global Discover Feed:** Find new books and interesting users on a global feed of all recent activity.
